# Appetit Recipe Application 

Appetit application is an application that contains recipes fetching API from https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/ by Jonas Schmedtman. I develop this application following steps as his lesson and try to creat another feature challenges and design some front-end by my own. Food  and some hand-drawn pictures were created by me via photoshop skills and some downloaded from freepik and unsplash website that allows to use for non-commercial.   


The Appetit application features is architected in MVC patterns <the model, the view and the controller> that handle specific development in each feature. I create models to response all the data-related to transfer between the view and controller components that make it easy. The application provides features as following; 

1) Search functionality/ API search request
2) Results with pagination
3) Display recipe
4) Change serving functionality (people and ingredients)
5) Bookmarking functionality
6) Store bookmark data in the browser (using window.localStorage)
7) On page load, read saved bookmarks
8) Add new recipe (Ajax call)

Finally, thanks to Jonas for instruction of this wonderful app!
